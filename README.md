# Shila Drupal Theme StarterKit

A StarterKit for the [Twig Edition of Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-twig-standard). Used in developing Drupal 8 themes and Pattern Lab style guides based on [Shila theme](https://github.com/aleksip/shila-drupal-theme). At the moment a forked version of Pattern Lab is required for Drupal template compatibility.

Tries to follow [Drupal CSS coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/coding-standards/css).

A Pattern Lab generated style guide can be found [here](https://aleksip.github.io/styleguide-shila-drupal-theme/) (online style guide might not be up to date).

Please note that this StarterKit is in early stages of development.
